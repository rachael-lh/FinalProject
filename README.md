# âœ¨Your Goals Appâœ¨

Need a place to write and store your daily, monthly or annual goals? This is the app for you! 

The application I made allows you to input your details and your goals with the start and proposed end dates. We all know circumstances change along the way so you are able to edit and delete them as and when you need to. 

# Project Brief ðŸ“‘

The application is designed to meet the requirements set out by the QA community project brief. The project is designed to encompass the following:

- To create a multi-tier web application that demonstrates CRUD functionality.
- To utilise containers to host and deploy your application.
- To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline.

Tools used to achieve the requirements are:

* Kanban Board: GitHub
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Application configuration: Python 
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX

# How I tracked the projectðŸ”Ž

For project tracking, I used GitHub Project - *enter link here*. This is required to plan out what tasks are required to build, amend, test and deploy the application. GitHub Project allows these steps to be presented in a clear and orderly manner via a Kanban Board style. 

The Kanban board is divided into initial tasks, tasks completed and tasks in progress. As the project management was detailed in GitHub this allowed me to link the related pull requests to the task noted on the board - allowing for the upmost clarity of whether a task has been successfully actioned.
